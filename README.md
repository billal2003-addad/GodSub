# GodSub
An update for my first tool of gathering subdomains with python . More powerfull and faster with less code
A little script in python to automate the subdomain gatherting task for bug bounty hunters and web app hackers
With using Hackertarget API and submitting the domain as an input the script will grab all the subdomains 
of this last with their ip's
